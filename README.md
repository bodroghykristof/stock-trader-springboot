# Stock Trader Spring Boot

## Intro

Stock trading, also known as refers to the buying and selling of shares in a particular company; if you own the stock, you own a piece of the company. Trading is indeed a very stressful profession. One thing is important regarding stock trading: If what you are doing right now is not making you money. Why not try the opposite approach? One of your friends decided to invest some money into promising stocks. But of course, he needs to know what are the options. As a fellow developer he simply started to write a stock trading application. By the way, he is not so sure is it good or bad? He wanna cover his work with unit tests, and follow higher standards but he has only limited affordable time for this project. So he turns to you for help. Now you have to review and refactor his code to make it testable and guess what, easily extendable in sake of a better future development experience.

You don't hesitate and start dive into some unit testing industry standard to make his code fabulous.

This project is my first own project using Spring Framework.
